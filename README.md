This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, which attempts to access user data based on a dynamically parsed ID but omits crucial error handling for cases where the ID is not a valid integer. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling to address this vulnerability and improve robustness.
